# Set-up Instructions

## NetLogo - Imalia

NetLogo is cross-platform which proves advantageous in the case of a group project, as group members can download and use the software on their personal laptop.
NetLogo is available for download on the website https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/. The website also provides extensive documentation, tutorials and a library of sample models to aid the user in creating an agent-based model.
In order to download NetLogo, you need to ensure that your system is able to install it by checking the Application Requirements page: https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/requirements.html.
After checking the requirements, in order to install NetLogo you provide your name, the organisation you belong to, e-mail and any additional comments. The version that we used to create the main model is NetLogo 6.1.1, which is currently the latest version.


## NetLogo Web - Kian 
No particular set-up is required for NetLogo Web. All that is required is modern web-browser. Up until now, the list of tested browsers consists of Edge and Chrome.
