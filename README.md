# Group8 - ABM

## Summary 

Development of an agent-based model that reflects the spread of infection in a hospital.

## Description

The project is a website that contains a main agent-based model that shows the spread of infection in a hospital, whilst accounting for the impact of the level of hand hygiene and cleaning regimens present in the hospital. <br>
The project contains a number of components that collectively work to achieve the projectâ€™s goals: <br>
*	A main agent-based model with agents (patients, Healthcare Workers and Volunteers). The model displays the mean reproduction number of a patient among Healthcare Workers. A slider is used to vary hand hygiene level and a switch is used to apply an increased cleaning regimen to the model.<br>
*	A website that contains a homepage(project.html), as well as an about page(about.html), the main model (ABM.html), the complex model (ABM_Can.html), an APIC Calculator page(APIC.html) and a link to NetLogo Web (Upload Model on sidebar).
