- worldwide problem:
    1. Getting infections at the hospital.
    2. pathogens --> antibiotic resistance appearing and spreading.
- Easy to spread multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) in healthcare environments.
- Mode of transmission (uncertain but usually):
    1. exogenous
    2. endogenous
- Transmission occur:
    1. HCW–patient
    2. Environmental contamination
    3. Airborne spread
- Infection control strategies in hospital:
    1. hand disinfection procedures
    2. environmental  cleaning
    3. active  screening  for colonizationamong patients
    4. isolation of colonized individuals
    5. managing staffing levels
    6. antibiotic prescription 
    7. decolonization procedures
    8. patient cohorting
- Using agent-based models in this paper:  
  agent-based models -- where one keeps track of the state ofeach individual within the population throughout time, allow-ing one to model heterogeneities at the individual level.
- The points have been considered in these stochastic models:  
    1. spontaneous colonization of patients
    2. patient-to-staff and staff-to-patient contamination/colonization
    3. environmentalcontamination
    4. patient cohorting
    5. room configuration of thehospital ward
    6. staff hand-washing compliance level
    7. the presence of different types of HCWs or specific staff–patientcontact network structures
- This paper highlights: 
    1. the importance of maintaining highhand-hygiene compliance levels by healthcare worker
    2. support control strategies including to improve environmental cleaning during nosocomial outbreaks
    3. show the potential of some healthcare workers to act as super-spreaders during these outbreaks
