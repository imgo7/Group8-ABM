#CSS

## Bootstrap
**An open source CSS framework that we are using for our front-end development**
We are making us of Bootstrap to help give a neat and colourful finish to our HTML pages and we re using Bootstraps CSS libraries to aid us in this.
## Font Size, Colour etc.
We have largely been sticking to the default fonts provided with our bootstrap libraries and we do believe they do add a very nice touch to the overall design of the front-end website of our project
We are using colours on the website that allude to the design of of the SureWash logo. We have also made use of CSS by creating fake images for our mockups and current prototype.
