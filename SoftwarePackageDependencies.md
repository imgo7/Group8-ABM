Front End
Bootstrap stylesheets:
The overall design of the website was largely influenced by a HTML & CSS library called Bootstrap which we firstly downloaded to our own machines to give us an idea of its capabilities before including a web based version in our HTML pages. The design of the header and footer were created using Bootstrap Jumbotron.

Toggled Sidebar with JavaScript:
The creation of the sidebar was aided by the use of a JavaScript library that allowed us design the the sidebar in a way that was aesthetically pleasing as well being fully functional and easy to use.
