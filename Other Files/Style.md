I used Bootstrap in order to put colour and style into the pages on the website. I had no prior information on how to code in Bootstrap,
so I used getbootstrap.com to learn different aspects of the coding. Using sample code shown on getbootstrap.com, I learned how to apply
different style, colour, etc. to the website.
