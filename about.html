<h2>The Task</h2>
<p>Our project is to develop a web-based, interactive agent-based model to simulate the spread of nosocomial infections. The model we are basing our project on is from a <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2018.0060">paper</a> that was published in 2018 by The Royal Society. This paper outlined a mathematical model which allowed for a variety of different outcomes by altering the values of mltiple attributes associated with the model, allowing it to be used in a multitude of different scenarios.</p>

<h2>The Model</h2>

<p>
The process of infection takes into account the equation: X = {X(t)  = (I<sub>1</sub>(t),I<sub>2</sub>(t), …, I<sub>k</sub>(t))} where t ≥ 0 and I<sub>N</sub>(t) relates the number of Infectives at a certain level N at time t. The level is defined by the case study in question. The number of likely cases S<sub>N</sub>(t) is given by the equation L<sub>N</sub>-I<sub>N</sub>(t) for t≥0. An additional equation is found to define the states present. The states (i<sub>1</sub>,…, i<sub>k</sub>) refer to the number of contaminated individuals i<sub>N</sub> at the levels 1 ≤ N ≤ k. The final state F indicates the end of the transition of states. 
<br><br>Removal occurs at level N:  (i<sub>1</sub>,…,i<sub>k</sub> )→(i<sub>1</sub>,…,i<sub>N</sub>-1,…,i<sub>k</sub>) at rate α<sub>N</sub>(i<sub>1</sub>,…,i<sub>k</sub>)
<br><br>
Infection occurs at level N:  (i<sub>1</sub>,…,i<sub>k</sub> )→(i<sub>1</sub>,…,i<sub>N</sub>-1,…,ik) at rate β<sub>N</sub>(i<sub>1</sub>,…,i<sub>k</sub>)
<br><br>
Detection of the infection outbreak (i<sub>1</sub>,…,i<sub>k</sub> )→F at rate γ(i<sub>1</sub>,…,i<sub>k</sub>)
<br><br>
Every factor depends on the individual case study in question. The γ rate enables the discovery of where the pathogen is introduced.
The exact reproduction number refers to the number of infections that have been instigated by the individual until the person is removed or the outbreak has been detected successfully. This can be summed up by: R<sub>(i1,…,ik)</sub><sup>(N)</sup> = ∑<sub>(a=1)</sub><sup>k</sup> R<sub>(i1,…,ik)</sub>(N)<sup>(a)</sup>. R is the number of infections caused by the individual at a level N. This value is a global variable.

R<sub>(i1,…,ik)</sub><sup>(N)</sup> In the initial starting state the value R’s states encompass the basic reproduction number to produce the mean value. In this initial state R results in being R<sub>(0,..,0,1,…,0)</sub><sup>(N)</sup>. Infection and removal rates are calculated using the R<sub>(i1,…,ik)</sub><sup>(N)</sup> and R<sub>(i1,…,ik)</sub><sup>(N)</sup>(a) values. Every infected person at level N is removed at rate αN and every individual can be infected externally or by another individual with rate βN. Probabilities can be computed using the equation v<sub>(i1,…,ik)</sub><sup>(N)</sup>(q) = P(R<sub>(i1,…,ik)</sub><sup>(N)</sup>=q), q≥0.
The Markov chain consists of a system that is able to transition from state to state, whilst obeying rules relating to probability. The subsequent states are determined on the current state and time passed.
